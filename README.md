# Spring Boot Backend demo
I had a lot of fun while making this demo, I had to learn so many things from beginning like Maven, Spring Boot, Sprint JPA, Lombok but it the end i think it was worth to experience this kinda development cycle.
 
## Requirements
| Requirements | Reason |
| ------------ | :------: |
| Lombok       | To write less code and focus on business logic |
| MySQL connector | To connect MySQL database |
| Spring JPA | To have abstraction for CRUD
| Spring Boot | To write production ready code
| GraphQL kick-starter | Makes it easier to implement GraphQL
| H2 | To have memory database for testing purposes|
| Docker, Docker Compose | To kick start database.

### About GraphQL Kick Starter
You can find more information about it here https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-spring-boot

## Notes
You can also check the GraphQL on http://localhost:8080/graphiql \
I had trouble while writing unit test not because unit test itself but @SpringBootTest gave me a lot of trouble i am not sure how to fix it sorry :'(
